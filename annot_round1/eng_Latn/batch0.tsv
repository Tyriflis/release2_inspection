		1	4. New York For all New York’s bright-lights-big-city grandeur, one can always find a quiet neighborhood. The trick is balancing the city’s outsize spectacle with intimate experiences. The latest neighborhood to pull it off is the Chelsea arts district, between 10th and 11th avenues, most notable for the just-expanded High Line, a landscaped strip of elevated public space. On nearby blocks you’ll find buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, and Shigeru Ban, as well as marquee galleries such as Pace and Gagosian. For a picnic lunch, stop into Chelsea Market, a food-court-on-steroids, and savor a piece of the city that’s been voted No. 1 within the U.S. and Canada every year since 2000. More On Bossip!

		1	I notice that all of those absurd comparisons of Matt Wieters to Joe Mauer that I used to cringe over during the last three years have finally ground to a halt. I guess batting averages of .249, .262, .249 and .227 since 2009 will do that… And I won’t even bring up his on-base percentages compared to Mauer’s over the same time period… Be sure to let us know what you think.

		1	Recently I was looking for a lemon recipe and nothing in my cookbooks seemed right. When I turned to a friend for advice, she recommended two easy-to-search websites, All Recipes and Recipe Zaar. My friend and I looked together and ended up choosing a lemon cream cupcake recipe with a 4.4 (out of 5) star rating from All Recipes a few minutes later. Have you ever come to the library looking for a recipe for something in particular; maybe a good vegetable soup or simple chocolate cake? EVPL owns thousands of cookbooks but sometimes it can take a long time to browse them and find what you want. Next time you need a recipe fast, try one of these websites!	bc356ff6bf58f2d8aaf04c31548444c9

Looking for a reputable Dutch Neck AC repair contractor that can be trusted can save you hundreds of dollars in the long run. Instead of simply opening up a phone book and hiring the first company you see, take the time to make sure they can do the job well. Company profiles, reviews, and ratings are available online for many of the air conditioning repair contractors, and this information is often very indicative of what kind of service you can expect from a company. If you have no friends or family who can personally vouch for a specific Dutch Neck AC repair contractor, ask an employee a few simple questions about their general business practices. Depending on the answers they provide, you can decide whether or not to hire them for your AC repair needs. - Heating Services - Air Conditioning - Indoor Air Quality	1186638577838f3c7c5cf9a3367569ef

When Mandy Hixon faced a life-changing tragedy, she was lifted up by poignant verses and an outpouring of loving support through notes and cards.

And that God’s powerful words are still relevant, especially in trying times.” Prior to starting LOULOUBLUE, Mandy worked at various New York-based creative agencies specializing in fashion, lifestyle, luxury branding, and communications.	0751e018ce0613fee8cccc3504fc9afe

First is that you switched from using florescent lighting to using HID.

This also tends to make the plant tall and thinner. When you switched over to HID lightin

As an adult I had gotten into Marx and deliberately did not try to collect Plasticville buildings because, quite frankly, there were too many of them! For anyone interested in the line I suggest joining the Plasticville Collector's Associatio. From time-to-time a Plasticville structure does end up in The Cave, like this Firehouse which fits in well with the rest of Fire & Emergency collection. What's really nice about this set is the inclusion of two fire engines, a pumper and ladder truck. The Marx plastic firehouse only had one engine and it had no moving parts. The 'stucco' exterior is indicative of either a Southwest or perhaps even Florida design, but I s'pose it could be just about anywhere. Enjoy!	b04ec20d14fed5611021a61151fc9581

inting seller (Which it doesn't appear to be, so far), I think a Halo 2 update is all but guaranteed. I wouldn't be surprised if the same team responsible for this project is already hard at work on it. And there's no need to patch Halo 3. It works just fine installed to the hard drive. It's unfortunate you can't actually decrease loadtimes significantly by installing it, but it doesn't increase them significantly, either (Even when online, I've read).

		1	If the goal is to get attention or exposure on Pinterest, there’s one thing to consider with your pictures: go vertical. There is a horizontal limit to the size of images while there appears to be no vertical limit at all. Images that are “tall” will shrink down to the horizontal limit but extend down as long as possible. In the image above, you can see which image stands out (and it’s not just because it’s T-Mobile’s spokesperson Carly Foulkes). The images that are wide do not stand out nearly as much. Keep this in mind when putting together pages intended to be viewed and shared on Pinterest.	b6858febac298f3ede96bc91b613574c

Rain storms are common in warm months and the tread pattern on summer tires is specially designed to clear water from under the tire to prevent hydroplaning. However, winter/snow tires should not be used in warm weather on dry pavement. The softer rubber compound will wear faster, and because the deep, aggressive tread leaves less rubber on the road, traction, handling and braking capabilities will suffer"	1e36d78e46b01323e284666574e9e682

If a ship should run aground or start to sink, thousands of people would need to channel through its corridors in order to reach lifeboats. Swarms of virtual passengers can reveal where bottlenecks and blockages will occur. Other programs model how fire would spread through a ship, helping engineers design ways to mitigate the danger of catastrophe.
