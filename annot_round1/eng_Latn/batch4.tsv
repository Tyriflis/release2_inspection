He writes with his industrial rock roots planted firmly, but don’t be fooled: he may be a composer entranced by the darkness of the human condition, but he isn’t one to be pigeonholed. He’s a lover of campy art flicks as much as he is the visceral source of your next trip. His recordings are rife with unabashed sexuality, gutter-punk abandon and tasty grooves.

			Hi Larry, one of my new hitting partners is playing pretty well against me lately, and I think it's due to her relatively good pushing game (and maybe her being left handed as well). Her pushes are often very angled, so I find myself running side to side to keep up, they're always low so I usually don't feel confident going for a flip (especially since I'm often put off balance by her placement), and they usually only go long when I'm too out of position to attack it. Some ideas I have to deal with this: look to go for the flip more when the push is not too angled, use more well placed deep pushes to get her to give a long push back, make a better attempt to attack the balls that do go long even if they're not exactly where I like them, do something to improve my footwork/anticipation/recovery. Do you have any thoughts?	73f025970ba7eedd840bdea459686f2a

			Tim West’s unique ability to see his drawings 3-dimensionally before ever cutting a single piece of paper allows him to actually sculpt light and shadow by using paper to achieve his vision. The sculptures in the Tim West Fine Art Collection begin with as few as 20 hand-cut paper pieces to well over 1,000. The pieces are then scored, rolled, sculpted and assembled to bring a Tim West original to life. Depending on complexity, an original sculpture can take anywhere from three weeks to three months to create. Disney, FOX Studios, Gibson Greeting Cards, Kodak and Sesame Workshop are just a few of the companies that have showcased the work of Tim West. West’s history with Disney spans more than 15 years, and includes numerous awards for his work, including Print Magazine’s Design Award for his collaboration on the Walt Disney World Resort’s Amenities Package.	015a27dcb8ff19a0f52fb96cd1d89c59

			Question: Do we know of any genes that predispose someone to developing rheumatoid arthritis? Answer: We do know or at least believe that rheumatoid arthritis has a genetic component to it. There are genes that have been identified that may predispose some patients to getting rheumatoid arthritis and other genes that actually may make the arthritis worse if you do get it. A lot of this is preliminary at this point, and it's not ready to be used in clinical practice. So in effect, there are no genes that we can test for to see if a patient is going to develop rheumatoid arthritis or have rheumatoid arthritis on a routine basis just yet. That may be something we'll be doing in the future however. Next: Can An Infection Or Previous Medical Condition Increase My Risk Of Developing Rheumatoid Arthritis?

			I have a swirly thing in my right eye, when I look forward it seems to be at right at the side, when I look down it gets worse and comes to most of the eye, also if I look at something I can only seem to see half of the face as it goes blurry. it is making me feel sick and dizzy if I move my eyes left and right quickly, I also have a few black floaters in both eyes but that isn't unusual. Written answer: Qualified optometrist Simon Kay BSc(Hons) MCOptom answers this question. This is likely to be another type of floater (although it could be a different problem) and although a nuisance, will not do you any harm, except occasionally they can arise from a problem with the retina, so as a precaution you should arrange an eye test as soon as possible where the optometrist will check you vision and examine your eye for any abnormality.
