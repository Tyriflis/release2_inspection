Although GIMP is considered only to be a marginal alternative to larger graphics editors such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel PaintShop Pro, the software has seen extensive use in professional graphics and film production. Many Linux-based studios prefer employing GIMP rather than running Photoshop with a Windows compatibility layer or emulator, as Walt Disney currently does.

For instance, if you twisted your ankle, the first thing you should do is apply some cold like a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a cloth or an ice pack. Keep this cold on the sore spot for about twenty minutes every few hours to help bring down the swelling. However, if you overdo the housework or gardening and f

			Echinacea is one of the most popular natural remedies among U.S. children and teens, according to a report recently published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine. For the report, researchers analyzed data on 9,417 people ages four to 17 and found that - along with fish oil - echinacea was one of the two most widely used dietary supplements. Said to stimulate the immune system, echinacea is often used to fight off colds and flu. Indeed, a number of studies show that taking echinacea as soon as symptoms set in might lessen the severity and duration of a cold. There's also some evidence that echinacea may help soothe sore throat. Although echinacea seems to be safe for most children, the National Institutes of Health warn that about seven percent of kids ages two to 11 may experience an allergy-induced rash when taking the herb.

			2. Don’t judge It became common for people to get picked apart and judged for their looks, actions, and performance. When you become aware that a friend or a co-worker has insecurities or feel ashamed about something, create a supportive environment by letting them know you understand how they feel and are willing to be by their side as they’re trying to cope with the insecurities. Even the superiors at work often have their own insecurities and the pressure that comes with a high position pushes people into feeling distrusting and paranoid. The more people around you feel like it’s safe to be flawed and vulnerable, the more they will trust you. The key to maintaining this trust is to never, ever use people’s insecurities or things told in trust against them.	24e90c03723d32751f3dfcf6dae97b3f

Arrested and brought before the Imperial authorities, no torture could induce him to consent to take part in heathen rites. One of his guards was so moved by the sight of the constancy of the Martyr that he too proclaimed himself a Christian, and was in consequence beheaded. This is the Saint Heraclius honoured with Saint Alexander. Other converts followed. Saint Alexander and his disciples were in the end all put to death.

			Hive Date Functions – all possible Date operations Handling DATE in HIVE is not as easy as compared to many traditional RDBMS in the market.

If any function or date format is not compatible, it will give NULL as output in place of error. This makes identification of wrong date manipulation in HIVE more tricky. We have used DATE_FORMAT which is available from Hive 1.2 onwards. There is more than one way to achieve same result and we have listed it where ever possible. Also you can use your own methodsRead More →	a88ae12b77bb0eba14eeb8b9a293e9f8
