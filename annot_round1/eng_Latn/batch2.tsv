			Any sneaker, any time – that's the idea behind Stance's latest sock collection, Ventron. Created with sneakerheads in mind, the new range introduces FEEL360 technology to the market – a proprietary fibre treatment that adapts and reacts to the atmosphere inside the sock to keep your feet cool, dry and fresh all day long, eliminating 99.95 percent of bacteria in the process. Better still, Stance claim that the combination of new tech and premium yarn makes the socks two times more durable than the competition, so don't expect them to hole out anytime soon – if at all! The Ventron collection features three different heights of sock, including an all-new low silhouette. Debut colourways include lime, coral, aqua and sand, as well as black and white staples. The new Stance Ventron collection is available right now, exclusively at Foot Locker.	b4073ab005696dff4ae013933a9668b7

			"Switzerland got their Euro 2016 campaign up and running with a hard-fought 1-0 win against 10-man Albania in a feisty Group A clash. Albania’s nerves were understandable but goalkeeper Etrit Berisha’s decision to come for a fifth-minute corner was misguided at best as he completely missed Xherdan Shaqiri’s cross, allowing Fabian Schar to head home.

""When pterosaurs hatched, they were tiny versions of adults,"" Unwin told New Scientist, and ""probably"" could fly and survive on their own. In contrast, modern birds hatch with undeveloped wings, and require parental care to survive."	5b695bf87a753dc92cdbf80c7ae120c0

			"I/M 240 is an ""enhanced"" inspection/maintenance vehicle emissions testing program for improving air quality in areas that fail to meet the federal government's ambient air quality standards. The test is similar to the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) that auto makers use to certify new vehicle emissions. A key feature of the I/M 240 test procedure is the use of a special inertia dynamometer to simulate vehicle loads at various speeds during a 240-second drive cycle that includes acceleration, decele

			I love painting and people so I combine both together. I manage to put a serene feeling into the work which I guess reflects my personality and I think brings out the things I love, that feeling of being outside and in the mountains. I also love the native Indian dress and jewellery which I’ve started trying to combine; the influence which I think comes from my Dad drawing them. If I don’t have a painting on the go I get a bit restless so that keeps me going. I chose to paint large scale canvas works that search for what’s hidden under the surface of everybody’s life. The dark, rebellious side comes through, with influences from the punk scene and my photographic past working with street performers and the homeless. Self Portrait	7eedce74232778729fc14d3853b4ef70
